# Below document talks about how to use ARGO rollout method to setup Kubernetes Blue Green Deployment setup 

Argo Rollouts â†’ Blue/Green Deployment 

Progressive traffic shifting, rollback support, dependency is it requires Argo Rollouts setup
Below defines the Argo Rollout resource, replacing the traditional Deployment. It manages Blue-Green deployments with automatic promotion after 24 hours.

Below is the folder structure for the sample app

â”‚â”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rollout.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service-active.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service-preview.yaml

# Deployment model with ArgoRollout feature

Argo Rollouts manages ReplicaSets directly, keeping two versions active at the same time (Blue & Green), allowing immediate rollbacks, traffic shifting, and manual approvals.

ðŸš€ Key Takeaways
âœ” Argo Rollouts uses a single Rollout resource to manage ReplicaSets directly (no Deployments required).
âœ” Blue-Green deployments are controlled by activeService & previewService, making traffic switching instant.
âœ” Rollbacks are instant since the old ReplicaSet is still running.
âœ” Rolling updates (Deployments) cause downtime, while Argo Rollouts prevents it.

Would you like an example of manual approval before switching to Green using Argo Rollouts? ðŸš€
