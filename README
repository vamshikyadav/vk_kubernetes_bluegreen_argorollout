# Below document talks about how to use ARGO rollout method to setup Kubernetes Blue Green Deployment setup 

Argo Rollouts → Blue/Green Deployment 

Progressive traffic shifting, rollback support, dependency is it requires Argo Rollouts setup
Below defines the Argo Rollout resource, replacing the traditional Deployment. It manages Blue-Green deployments with automatic promotion after 24 hours.

Below is the folder structure for the sample app

my-app/
│── charts/
│── templates/
│   ├── rollout.yaml
│   ├── service-active.yaml
│   ├── service-preview.yaml
│   ├── argocd-application.yaml
│── values.yaml
│── Chart.yaml

# Deployment model with ArgoRollout feature


Step  |	Kubernetes Deployment |	Argo Rollouts (ReplicaSets Model)
--- | --- | ---
1. | Deploy v1	Creates ReplicaSet for v1 |	Creates ReplicaSet for v1 (Blue)
2. | Deploy v2	Replaces Pods gradually	| Creates new ReplicaSet for v2 (Green), keeps v1 running
3. | Test v2	No built-in mechanism	| Traffic is routed to my-app-preview
4. | Promote v2	Pods of v1 are terminated, | v2 is rolled out	Switches my-app-active to v2, deletes old v1
5. Rollback if failure	Recreates v1 Pods (takes time) |	Switches my-app-active back to v1 instantly
